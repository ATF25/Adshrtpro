I cannot read the compressed archive file (.tar.gz) directly as it's a binary format. To generate comprehensive design guidelines for your website, I need to understand what the project is about.

**Please provide one of the following:**

1. **Extract the files in Replit** and share the actual code/HTML files, or
2. **Describe your website's purpose**: What is the website for? (e.g., portfolio, e-commerce, blog, landing page, SaaS product, etc.)
3. **Share key details**: Who is the target audience? What's the main goal? Any design preferences or references?

Once I understand your project's context, I'll create detailed design guidelines covering:
- Design approach (reference-based or system-based)
- Typography hierarchy and font selections
- Layout system and spacing primitives
- Component specifications
- Page structure recommendations
- Image placement strategy

**Quick alternative:** If you can describe what "logojakes" is about in 2-3 sentences, I can immediately generate tailored design guidelines for your project.
